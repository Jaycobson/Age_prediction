This is a regression problem because the target is composed of continuous values. CNNs are able to classify images and get accurate with pretrained models. Regression is a difficult task for CNNs but they are still capable of giving good outputs.

In this project, I used CNN models(both pretrained and custom), the loss fucntion is the mean squared error. The mobilenet pretrained model gave the best predictions.
